    - Using Async Code more Elegantly

400. Whats Async Await All About?

    - 2 Keywords that let us write async code like sync code;

    - About asynchronous code:
        - We tipically work with promises (using .then());
        - We could also work with callbacks (it would create the callback hell)

    - It gets more readable with ayncs and 26. Async Await.txt

401. Transforming "Then Catch" to "Async Await"
    
    - We set the async when creating the function;

    - Then we await the return, instead of createing a promise;

    - We then set our logic with try and catch
    
        exports.getPosts = async (req, res, next) => {
            try{
            const totalItems = await Post.find().countDocuments();
            } catch (err) {
                //... Error handling
            }
        }
    
    - Max emphasized that JavaScript is different from other languages, in JS the async await will kinda transform in then() and catch() behind the scenes
